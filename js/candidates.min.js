His platform to help the BCOE student body is to provide more tutoring services for engineering students, allow more connections for students to be involved in a BCOE organization, and give more funding to BCOE organizations for outreach/development projects. Joel’s agenda is to guide and benefit present and future BCOE students during and after their studies at UCR. Joel would like to thank all the people supporting his campaign for BCOE senator for the 2018-2019 school year.",endorsement:{}},{name:"Johnathan Thai",img:"./img/Candidates_Pictures/BCOE/Johnathan.JPG",major:"Computer Science",bio:"My name is Jonathan Thai, I am a second year computer science major, and I will be running in this years ASUCR elections as a candidate for the BCOE senator position. I would like to get involved and represent the student body to the best of my abilities. As a senator for BCOE I would push for more beneficial programs for students to succeed. Such programs may be SI sessions and professional development workshops. Due to difficult classes and intense course loads students feel overwhelmed and unprepared for many classes they take. With the addition of more SI sessions it will allow students to stay on track with their classes and further cement topics from their courses.",endorsement:{}},{name:"Maurice Armstrong",img:"./img/Candidates_Pictures/BCOE/Maurice.JPG",major:"Environmental Engineering",bio:"As an engineering student, I have seen many of my fellow peers leave the field of engineering for a more open-minded and less relentless areas of study. It is said that 60% of students that begin in engineering leave or drop out. As BCOE senator I wish to address this area of concern by creating event and opportunities that help inspire and remind students why they choose engineering in the first place. As a senator, I wish to continue the Undergraduate Research Expo and I would like to begin a seminar series that would exhibit research and contemporary problems in the field. In addition, I would like to create and strengthen ties with industry by reinvigorating the Industrial Mentoring Program. Equally important, I as a BCOE senator would like to promote self-care among engineering students as well as across the campus. Engineering students study the most and sleep the least according to studies, which can lead to high levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issue. Thus, I wish to begin to cultivate a place where students do not feel degraded by talking about their issues.",endorsement:{}},{name:"Sarah Al-Khalili",img:"./img/Candidates_Pictures/BCOE/Sarah.JPG",major:"Bioengineering",bio:"My name is Sarah Al-Khalili and I am a first year bioengineering major. I am running to become your BCOE Senator because I feel that as BCOE students, our voices are the least heard on this campus. As BCOE Senator, I will tackle issues such as reducing the costs of unnecessary expenses like lab notebooks, lab coats, access codes, clickers, textbooks. BCOE students constantly have to pay extra fees on top of tuition just to be able to take the classes needed to fulfill major requirements and I hope to be the one who initiates these changes. As Senator, I hope to bridge the gaps between different communities on campus to highlight its diverse atmosphere. ",endorsement:{}}]};
