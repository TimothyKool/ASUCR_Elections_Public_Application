              <p>Your student paper needs your help. The Highlander Newspaper has stood for 63 years as UC Riverside’s independent
                and student-run media outlet, serving as a critical source of vital information, engaging commentary and
                quality storytelling for students and the community. Though, as independent media is disappearing, The Highlander
                is struggling to stay afloat. A $1.00 increase to the current quarterly fee of $2.00 (to be collected fall,
                winter, spring and summer quarters — effective starting fall 2018) would help absorb the Highlander’s steadily
                rising print, maintenance and operating costs to ensure it continues serving you and the campus by:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Providing practical experience for students interested in journalism, marketing, media production, and design
                  on a campus without a journalism program</li>
                <li>Delivering breaking news and commentary on the issues that affect the future of our campus</li>
                <li>Expanding media team and resources to consistently hold campus administrators, faculty, and student leaders
                  accountable
                </li>
                <li>Giving a platform for students, clubs, and organizations to tell their stories and highlight their service
                  to campus</li>
              </ul>

              <p>In accordance with campus policy, 25% of the new fee, or $0.25, would be returned to financial aid. Do you
                support a $1.00 quarterly fee increase for the Highlander Newspaper Revitalization as described above?</p>

              <p>
                <strong>YES</strong>, I vote to pass the Highlander News Referendum Fee, which will increase the Highlander Newspaper
                Fee by $1.00, for a total of $3.00 per quarter, which will begin in Fall 2018.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>NO</strong>, I do not vote to pass the Highlander News Referendum Fee, hich will increase the Highlander
                Newspaper Fee by $1.00.</p>

            <div class="background">
              <p>
                <strong>Introduction:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>The Highlander News Referendum is an effort by the Highlander Newspaper student staff to preserve UC Riverside’s
                63-year-long standing, independent student-run news source. As the only newspaper on campus, the Highlander
                champions free speech and serves as a source of critical, honest, and vital information for students on campus
                life, student leaders, the administration, and larger Riverside community.</p>

              <p>Since setting the quarterly Highlander Newspaper fee at $2.00 in 2001, the publication has provided numerous
                career opportunities for students despite the growing challenges of maintaining an independent media source.
                Now, as rising rental costs and declining print advertising threaten to take away these jobs and the paper
                altogether, your school newspaper needs your help!</p>

              <p>The referendum proposes that the current Highlander Newspaper fee be raised by $1.00 for undergraduates to
                fund rising printing costs, space rental increases and operational expansions, all to ensure the existence
                of jobs for students interested in journalism, marketing, media production, and design. At a school without
                a journalism program, providing students with practical experience in these fields is critical.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Funding/Oversight:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>A $1.00 increase to the quarterly Highlander Newspaper fee (less than half the cost of your regular Starbucks
                coffee) will be established by a referendum vote of the student body, and be run through the Associated Students
                office. The Highlander Editorial Board will monitor the expenditures created by the additional revenues.</p>

              <p>The current undergraduate fee to fund the Highlander Newspaper is $2.00 per quarter. The proposed increase
                of $1.00 will increase that fee to $3.00 per quarter. In accordance with campus policy, 25% of the new fee,
                or $0.25, would be returned to financial aid. The remaining $2.75 would fund the Highlander Newspaper starting
                in fall 2018. The fee would be collected fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Referendum Passage:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>In compliance with UC and UCR policies, this referendum must meet the following criteria during elections to
                be approved by the student body:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>At least 20% of the student body must vote on the issue.</li>
                <li>A majority of the votes cast must vote in favor of the issue.</li>

              <p>If approved, in Fall 2020 this referendum will replace the current HESSR fee of $14.00 per quarter for a net
                increase of $2.00 per quarter and will include Undocumented Student Programs. The new fee effective Fall
                2020 would be $16.00 per quarter.</p>
              <p>Do you support a quarterly fee of $16.00 per undergraduate student for the eight student services programs
                to meet growing student needs by providing student events and services, programming, collaborative projects,
                student leadership and employment opportunities, and operational support for students?</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Fee will replace the current HESSR fee, effective Fall 2020</li>
                <li>Fee will be assessed to undergraduate students in Fall, Winter, Spring, & Summer quarters</li>
                <li>25% of the fee ($4.00 per quarter) will be returned to financial aid to help offset costs for students who
                  are eligible for financial aid</li>
                <li>The remaining $12.00 per quarter will be split evenly amongst all ethnic and gender programs, currently eight
                  programs, and transferred to each program’s budget.</li>
                <li>Currently the eight programs include: African Student Programs, Asian Pacific Student Programs, Chicano Student
                  Programs, LGBT Resource Center, Middle Eastern Student Center, Native American Student Programs, Undocumented
                  Student Programs, and Women’s Resource Center.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The approval of this referendum would provide for</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Increased co-programming with student organizations and student-led initiatives, including funding and advising</li>
                <li>Staffing to assist students in finding support and resources</li>
                <li>Support for conference hosting and conference travel</li>

                <li>Peer mentoring and peer education programs support</li>

              </ul>

              <p>A yes vote means that you support the $1.00 increase of the Highlander Newspaper Fee for a total of $3.00 per
                quarter, which will begin in Fall 2018.</p>

            <div class="background">
              <p>
                <strong>Introduction:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>This referendum acknowledges the student body of University of California, Riverside (“UCR”) is interested
                in improving and expanding campus services, resources, programs, and leadership activities through African
                Student Programs, Asian Pacific Student Programs, Chicano Student Programs, LGBT Resource Center, Middle
                Eastern Student Center, Native American Student Programs, Undocumented Student Programs, and Women’s Resource
                Center (“eight programs”).</p>
              <p>The eight programs are united in their mission to serve all UCR students. Even as UCR enrollment has increased,
                as well as expenses associated with providing services and programming, the permanent budgets of the eight
                programs have not grown.</p>
              <p>In 2015, the Highlander Empowerment Student Services Referendum was approved to temporarily enhance funding
                for seven ethnic and gender program offices providing vital student services to all undergraduate students.
                Since passage, available funding from Student Services Fees has not improved, while the need for student
                services provided by the ethnic and gender program offices has increased. In addition, Undocumented Student
                Programs has been established as a new office to help create equal opportunity at UCR for all students to
                get a quality education, regardless of immigration status.</p>
              <p>The 2015 Highlander Empowerment Student Services Referendum provides temporary funding only through Spring
                2020. The needs of students helped by HESSR funds are not temporary, however.</p>
              <p>Since 2015, the Highlander Empowerment Student Services Referendum fee has allowed the ethnic and gender program
                offices to provide vital resources and staffing. HESSR funding is critical to assisting distressed students,
                struggling with issues ranging from hate crimes and incidents, family and financial situations interfering
                with academic success, sexual assault and sexual harassment, suicide and other mental health and wellness
                concerns. HESSR funding results in new employment for students and co-sponsorship opportunities for student
                organizations. HESSR funding makes possible campus-wide speakers, performers, conferences, and community-building
                events that educate and empower all Highlanders.</p>
              <p>Permanent funding for the Highlander Empowerment Student Services Referendum will allow the eight programs
                to continue to meet undergraduate students’ needs by providing:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Increased co-programming with student organizations and student-led initiatives, including funding and advising</li>
                <li>Staffing to assist students in finding support and resources</li>
                <li>Support for conference hosting and conference travel</li>
                <li>Support for Common Ground Collective projects & collaborative initiatives with the Diversity Council</li>
                <li>Peer mentoring and peer education programs support</li>
                <li>More resources in each student program office and center, such as student computer support and educational
                  materials
                </li>
                <li>Operational support for student services programs as described above, as the costs of campus services continue
                  to increase</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Funding:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>If approved, this referendum fee will be assessed to undergraduate students beginning in Fall 2020 at $16.00
                per quarter (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer), as well as provide financial aid funds to meet the University
                of California “return-to-aid” requirement (see “Return-to-Aid” section below). Of the $16.00 fee collected
                from undergraduate students, $4.00 per quarter will go to student financial aid. $12.00 per quarter will
                be split evenly amongst the eight programs, and transferred to each program’s budget. Since Undocumented
                Student Programs funds are currently housed under the Chicano Student Programs departmental budget, CSP will
                receive the Undocumented Students Program share of this fee and ensure it is allocated to that program. If
                USP becomes a stand-alone department in the future, their share will go to the USP departmental budget versus
                being combined with CSP.</p>

              <p>The fee would be assessed without end, unless a determination is made by the Chancellor to eliminate the fee.
                Up to every five years, beginning in Fall 2024, and following consultation with RSAC, the Chancellor will
                assess the overall effectiveness of the use of the funds and the extent to which their use still reflects
                the spirit of the referendum. Based on that assessment, if the Chancellor determines the fee is no longer
                needed or is not used in the spirit of the referendum, then the fee will terminate at the end of the summer
                term following the Chancellor's decision.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>"Return-to-Aid":</strong>
              </p>

              <p>In accordance with University of California policy, 25% of the amount collected from this fee ($4.00 per quarter)
                will be returned to UC Riverside students in the form of undergraduate financial aid.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Governance:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>Highlander Empowerment Student Services Referendum funds directed to the eight programs will be governed by
                the Referendum Student Advisory Committee (“RSAC”), under the authority of the Chancellor or Chancellor's
                designate. RSAC will be made up of sixteen members to include eight UCR undergraduate students (with voting
                privileges) nominated by the Director of each of the eight programs; eight staff members representing the
                eight programs (ex-officio non-voting); and one staff member (ex-officio non-voting) nominated by the Chancellor
                or the Chancellor's designate to provide administrative support. RSAC will submit the Bylaws to UCR's Campus
                Counsel Office for review and endorsement. RSAC will recommend to the Chancellor or Chancellor's designate,
                for final approval, how the Highlander Empowerment Student Services Referendum funds will be utilized a portion
                of the funds going directly to the eight programs will be used to support and sustain the work of RSAC. An
                annual public RSAC report will summarize the use of Highlander Empowerment Student Services Referendum funds.</p>

                <strong>Introduction:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>The Green Campus Action Plan (GCAP) is a collective effort by the undergraduate students of the University
                of California at Riverside to significantly reduce the world’s overall environmental impact, assist in achieving
                UCR’s 2025 carbon neutrality goal, and bring recognition to the UCR campus or its affiliates.</p>

              <p>The plan proposes the continued funding of environmental and basic-needs internship opportunities, the availability
                of Green Grants to empower students and their organizations to help reduce the world’s environmental impact,
                and Green Initiatives prescribed by the GCAP committee.</p>

              <p>The aim of GCAP is to transform UC Riverside’s commitment to climate neutrality and sustainability into one
                of bold and effective leadership. Ultimately, contributing to the university’s role as a premier research
                institution that inspires, educates, and leads the community it serves.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Funding:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>The GCAP fee will fund GCAP by providing funds for the continuance of GCAP programs and services as summarized
                below. It will also satisfy the University of California ‘return to aid’ requirement (see ‘Return to Aid’
                section below)</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Green Initiatives for large scale projects that heavily incorporate renewable energy sources.</li>
                <li>Green Grants for student organizations, projects, and GCAP events.</li>
                <li>GCAP Internships, Leadership opportunities, and educational components.</li>
                <li>It would also combine the existing GCAP funds to the new referendum guidelines. Excess funds in each category
                  would individually roll over annually.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The proposed undergraduate fee to fund these initiatives would be $2.50 per quarter, including summer.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Return-to-Aid</strong>
              </p>

              <p>In accordance with campus policy, 25% of the amount collected from this fee ($0.625 cents) would be returned
                to UC Riverside students in the form of undergraduate financial aid. The remaining $1.875 would continue
                to fund GCAP starting in the Summer of 2014.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Distribution of Fees:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>All allocations will be made in accordance with ASUCR Standing Order #8 – Green Campus Action Plan (GCAP) and
                ASUCR by-laws. The fee will be allocated as follows:</p>
              <p>$1.205 of the fee each quarter would be allocated to fund the estimated costs associated with the implementation
                of each green initiative.</p>
              <p>$0.10 cents of the fee per quarter would be allocated to the GCAP Green Grants for student organizations and
                clubs
              </p>
              <p>$0.57 cents of the fee per quarter would be allocated to fund annual student positions in organizations that
                strive to improve our environment and dedication to sustainability.</p>
              <p>Any excess or increase in funds due to a growing undergraduate population would individually roll over annually
                in each category.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Governance:</strong>
              </p>

              <p>The GCAP Committee is comprised of ten (10) undergraduate students including an Undergraduate Sustainability

                and Finance Committee members. The GCAP funds will be allocated by the GCAP Committee and ratified by the
                Senate.
              </p>
              <p>The GCAP Committee would be responsible for:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ensuring the Green Initiatives are funded and implemented in a timely manner.</li>

                <li>Continuing the goal of keeping GCAP accountable and transparent to the UCR student body.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The GCAP Implementation Committee shall adhere to all further rules and regulations as prescribed by the ASUCR
                Senate, UCR Policies and any standing orders that may arise.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Referendum Passage:</strong>
